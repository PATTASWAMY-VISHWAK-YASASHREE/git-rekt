# Git Rekt üî•

A web app that takes a GitHub username and roasts them based on their contributions, commit messages, and questionable emoji use.

## Features

- üîç **Profile Analysis**: Analyzes GitHub profiles, repositories, and activity patterns
- üìù **Commit Message Roasting**: Identifies generic messages, emoji overuse, and poor formatting
- üìä **Repository Quality Check**: Evaluates repo naming, descriptions, and maintenance
- üéØ **Activity Pattern Analysis**: Looks at coding habits and contribution patterns
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Roasts**: Optional Google Gemini integration for more creative and personalized roasts
- üé® **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive design with smooth animations

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PATTASWAMY-VISHWAK-YASASHREE/git-rekt.git
   cd git-rekt
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables (optional)**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local and add your Google Gemini API key for enhanced roasts
   ```

4. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## How It Works

1. Enter a GitHub username
2. **Optional**: Add your own Google Gemini API key for AI-powered roasts
3. The app fetches public data from GitHub's API:
   - User profile information
   - Recent repositories
   - Commit messages from recent repos
   - Public activity events
4. Analyzes the data for roasting opportunities:
   - Generic commit messages ("fix", "update", etc.)
   - Emoji overuse in commits
   - Poor repository naming conventions
   - Inconsistent contribution patterns
   - Profile completeness issues
5. Generates personalized roasts:
   - **With Gemini API**: Uses AI to create witty, context-aware roasts
   - **Fallback**: Uses traditional pattern-based roasts if no API key provided

## Roasting Categories

### üìù Commit Messages
- Generic messages without context
- Excessive emoji usage
- Overly long commit messages
- All caps messages
- Common typos

### üìÇ Repository Quality  
- Generic repository names
- Missing descriptions
- Abandoned projects
- Too many forks vs original work

### üë§ Profile Analysis
- Follower/following ratios
- Missing bio information
- Account age vs activity level

### ‚è∞ Activity Patterns
- Weekend warrior coding
- Late night commits
- Commit frequency patterns

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React
- **Styling**: CSS Modules
- **API**: Next.js API Routes
- **Data Source**: GitHub REST API
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (optional)

## Configuration

### Google Gemini API (Optional)

The app supports two ways to use AI-powered roasts:

#### For Development/Self-hosting
Add your API key to the environment variables:

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add it to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

#### For Public Deployment (Netlify/Vercel)
Users can provide their own API key through the web interface:

1. Deploy the app without any API key
2. Users enter their GitHub username
3. Users optionally add their own Gemini API key for enhanced roasts
4. The API key is used only for that session and not stored

If no API key is provided (either via environment or user input), the app will use traditional hardcoded roasts as fallback.

## API Usage

The app uses GitHub's public API and doesn't require authentication. It only accesses publicly available information.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by:
- Adding new roasting categories
- Improving the analysis logic
- Enhancing the UI/UX
- Adding more emoji crimes detection

## Deployment

### Netlify (Recommended for public deployment)

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account

2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub account and select the forked repository
   - Netlify will automatically detect the Next.js configuration

3. **Deploy**: 
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
   - No environment variables needed - users provide their own API keys!

4. **Done!** Your app will be live and users can optionally provide their own Gemini API keys for AI roasts.

### Other Platforms

The app can also be deployed to:
- **Vercel**: Perfect for Next.js, automatic deployments
- **Railway**: Good for containerized deployments
- **Heroku**: Classic PaaS option

For self-hosting or private deployment, you can set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable to provide a default API key.

## Disclaimer

This app is meant for entertainment purposes only. All roasts are generated based on publicly available GitHub data and are intended to be humorous, not offensive.
